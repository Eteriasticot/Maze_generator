# Maze generator
Just a <ins>maze generator</ins> in python. Ideally I'd like to generate different kinds of maze.

## Perfect maze
First of all, we need to define what a perfect maze is. A perfect maze must always have a single path between two of its points. This means a perfect maze can't have isolated areas and can't have any loop.
For example, this is a perfect maze:

## Algorythm
I used [CaptainLuma](https://www.youtube.com/@captainluma7991)'s maze generation algorithm to make this program.

This algorithm works by editing a perfect maze.
